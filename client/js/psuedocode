The project will include a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. 
If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. 
If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. 
Weatherbit API for you to see how another API accomplishes the same goals. 
Weatherbit API has one problem, it only takes in coordinates for weather data -- it’s that specific. 
So, we’ll need to get those coordinates from the Geonames API. 
Once we have all of this data, we’ll want to display an image of the location entered; 
for this, we will be using the Pixabay API.
